Things to add:
- Data Preprocessing
- Modeling Overview:
	1) Model tau_12, tau_13, tau_23 as a function of u,v,w,tke,theta,p
		- cut all boxes to 75% in z-direction
		- use max normalization
		- standard normalization
		- CNN vs DNN
		- which inputs are most predictive (u,v,w) vs (u,v,w,the) vs (u,v,w,theta) 		  vs all those including pressure
		- use correlation as a loss instead of mse
		- test different box sizes
		â€”> results in model x used to:
			a) train on Re15sh20-Coarse8, predict on Re15sh20-Coarse4, 	
			   Re15sh20-Coarse16, Re15sh20-Coarse24, Macro Channel-Coarse8
			b) train on Re15sh20-Coarse4, 8, 16 ad 24 as a combined dataset
	2) Model h_1, h_2, h_3, as a function of u,v,w,tke,theta,p
