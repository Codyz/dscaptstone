Things to add:
- Data Preprocessing
	1) cut all boxes to 75% in z-direction
	2) create boxes to predict tau
	3) create one dataset out of u,v,w,tke,theta,p
	4) "eliminated" tau_11, tau_22, tau_33
- Modeling Overview:
	1) Model tau_12, tau_13, tau_23 as a function of u,v,w,tke,theta,p
		- CNN vs DNN
		- use max normalization vs. standard normalization (especially important for tau_12) --> results in DNN/ipynb
		- which inputs are most predictive (u,v,w) vs (u,v,w,tke) vs (u,v,w,theta) vs (u,v,w,p) --> results in DNN/ipynb
		- use correlation as a loss instead of mse
		- test different box sizes
		â€”> results in model x used to:
			a) train on Re15sh20-Coarse8, predict on Re15sh20-Coarse4, 	
			   Re15sh20-Coarse16, Re15sh20-Coarse24, Macro Channel-Coarse8
			   - add distribution graph
	2) Model h_1, h_2, h_3, as a function of u,v,w,tke,theta,p
		- add distribution graph
- Next steps:
	1) train on Re15sh20-Coarse4, 8, 16 ad 24 as a combined dataset
		- add distribution graph
	2) Adding time as a factor for Re15sh20-Coarse8 T1-T8
